Completion suggester did not work. No ranking based on popularity, only custom weights (does that mean you must recompute weights when new documents enter??)

Term suggester did not work at query time. Need more exploration though (has options for popularity).

Edge n-grams are likely to work as part of the binary filter. Still unclear how to sort the options though.
